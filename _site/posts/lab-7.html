<p>In this lab, the aim is to grok the principles underlying the <a href="http://cmsc-16100.cs.uchicago.edu/2015/Lectures/20-monad-transformers.php">sudoku solver</a>. We will use very similar code to solve a related problem of <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>-onimoes a special case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover">exact-cover</a>. In our case the exact-cover problem, although more general, is not much harder to solve than these specific instantiations. In exact cover we are given a collection of sets and the goal is to select a mutually disjoint subcollection of them such that their union contains all the elements. “Cover” refers to the fact that the union contains all the elements; “exact” means that each set in the cover is disjoint from all the other sets–e.g. elements occur in only one of the selected sets. Use <a href="../fls/NState.hs">NState.hs</a> (you won’t need to make modifications) and you will modify <a href="../fls/sudoku.hs">sudoku.hs</a> into <code>ExactCover.hs</code> in your <code>lab7</code> repository folder (that you will make).</p>
<p>This lab is short and meant to be finished by end-of-day Wednesday. The problem is to build a program which will have the exact name <code>ExactCover</code> derived from the source <code>ExactCover.hs</code> which can solve exact cover instances.</p>
<p>You will run the program like so:</p>

<p>this shows that there are two ways to cover all the elements. We also have cases where there is no solution as in <a href="../fls/exact-cover2.txt"><code>exact-cover2.txt</code></a>:</p>

<p>This happens because there is no “cover”</p>
<p>The output should present the problem and the number of solutions. If there are solutions they should be listed (in no particular order). The number of solutions should be stated. I just used <code>show</code> on <code>Map</code> instances from <code>Data.Map</code> in order to actually display the solutions.</p>
<p>We are going to keep the basic structure as with <code>sudoku.hs</code> from the lecture notes. This means that a cover for the set will be implemented using <code>Map</code> from <code>Data.Map</code>. There are two types then to define: the keys and the values. To answer the question it is useful to work via analogy. In the sudoku example there are positions, and then we map a value to a particular position. There is a natural mapping relationship in this lab as well. The map should completely specify an exact-cover solution if it is completely filled in. As such we declare the type for the solution <code>Map</code> to be <code>Cover</code>. A <code>Solver</code> type can be analogously defined as in the sudoku case for <code>Board</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the objects we are covering are strings. Combine that with the proper definition of <code>Cover</code> and we have the basic type sets needed. To get a sense of this consider possible keys and values for <code>Cover</code>. A good design would mean that if every key has an assignment then the exact-cover problem should be solved and the values that are assigned should allow you to check the solution.</p>
<p>Following the description from the lecture we next implement <code>extend</code>. Observe that with <code>extend</code> in the sudoku case we consider all viable values for the cell. We also want to check viability here. This gives us a hint about what <code>Map</code> to use for <code>Cover</code>. In particular, we may view the map as a set of assignments, in sudoku our keys are the positions and in exact cover the exercise is to figure out what the keys should be.</p>
