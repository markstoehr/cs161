<p>Office hours 1-2pm on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<h1 id="counting-words">Counting Words</h1>
<p>In this lab we will produce a sorted word count from input text. The input will be a text stream as in the <code>rot13</code> program and you will output a list of words with their associated counts such that the words are sorted and all in lower-case. E.g. the text</p>
<pre><code>A parser for things
Is a function from strings
To lists of pairs
Of things and strings</code></pre>
<p>should output:</p>
<pre><code>a 2
and 1
for 1
from 1
function 1
is 1
lists 1
of 2
pairs 1
parser 1
strings 2
things 2
to 1</code></pre>
<p>Implement this as a program with the exact name <code>WordCount.hs</code> such that it can be run as <code>./WordCount</code> like the rot13 program. It should be in your <code>lab4/</code> directory of your laboratory repository. A word is defined as a contiguous sequence of letters with the characters <code>'\''</code> and <code>'-'</code>.</p>
<h1 id="collecting-permutations">Collecting Permutations</h1>
<p>Some words are permutations of each other: e.g. <code>[&quot;outs&quot;, &quot;oust&quot;]</code> or <code>[&quot;portions&quot;, &quot;positron&quot;]</code>. Write a second program which outputs the permutations in sorted order. E.g. given text</p>
<pre><code>On the Outer Pyre steps the three purest usurpers swore to their vile
pursuers they were no prey. The route was worse from the original form they
expected there as the live volcano nearby often erupts.</code></pre>
<p>the program should output</p>
<pre><code>erupts, purest
form, from
live, vile
no, on
outer, route
prey, pyre
pursuers, usurpers
swore, worse
there, three</code></pre>
<p>The words on a single line should be sorted as well as the lines themselves in the text output. Use the definition of a word given above. This program should be implemented with the exact name <code>CollectPermutations.hs</code> in your <code>lab4/</code> folder of your subversion repository. It should take in text just like the <code>rot13</code> program.</p>
<h1 id="to-hand-in">To hand in</h1>
<p>Your <code>lab4/</code> directory should have <code>CollectPermutations.hs</code> and <code>WordCount.hs</code>, each of which can be compiled to take in text input and output the desired text.</p>
