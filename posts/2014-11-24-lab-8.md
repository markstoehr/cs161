title: Lab 8: Mancala Part Deux
--------

A reference solution for lab 7 has been posted [here](../fls/MancalaBoardSol.hs).

The task for this lab is to:

- Write IO to allow two players to play the game
- write a README explaining your implementation and two player game

The IO should begin with a command:

```bash
$ ./playMancala
```

which can be compiled from a `playMancala.hs` file.  The game should alternate between the two players
and allow them to play a full game.  There should be a prompt for players to move
and in between moves the program should pretty-print the board state.  The game should halt when one player
wins.
