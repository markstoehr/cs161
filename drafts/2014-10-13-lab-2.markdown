# Special Note

This is an extra-credit lab.  The lab due this week is last week's lab.

# Rader's FFT

This lab introduces you to the fascinating world of FFT algorithms.  Recall that the FFT is nothing other
than evaluating a polynomial at the roots of unity.  There is no single
fastest FFT algorithm and every one has various tradeoffs in terms of memory, parallelization, time complexity
all of which usually depend on characteristics of the sequence you are analyzing.  In this lab
we will address how to efficiently compute an FFT for a prime-length sequence.

We note that this is missing from last-week's exposition since the recursive divide and conquer
algorithm required the input sequence to have length equal to $2^k$ for some integer $k$.

## Cyclic Groups

The central insight of [Rader's FFT algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rader%27s_FFT_algorithm)
is that an FFT of length $p$ may be computed with a convolution of two sequences of length $p-1$
where $p$ is a prime.  Recall that the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) evaluates a polynomial
of degree $N-1$
$a(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \cdots +a_{N-1}x^{N-1}$ on the $N$th roots of unity $\exp(-2\pi ik/N)$.
These roots of unity are 
<center> $$1,e^{-2\pi i\frac{1}{N}},e^{-2\pi i\frac{2}{N}},\ldots,e^{-2\pi i \frac{N-1}{N}}.$$</center>
The $k$th coefficient is
<center>$$ A_k=a\left(e^{-2\pi i\frac{k}{N}}\right) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n e^{-2\pi i\frac{kn}{N}}. $$  </center>

If $N$ is prime then the set of numbers $\{1,2,\ldots, N-1\}$ forms a group under multiplication modulo $N$:
i.e. for every $p\in \{1,2,\ldots,N-1\}$ there exists a $q\in\{1,2,\ldots,N-1\}$ such that 
<center> $$pq \equiv 1 \mod N$$</center>
which means that there is some integer $d$ such that $pq=dN+1$.  
A simple example of this is the case where $N=2$ then the only number in this group is $1$ and clearly
$1\cdot 1 = 0\cdot 2 + 1$.  The next group is $N=3$, in this case observe that $2\cdot 2=1\cdot 3+1$ so
$1=1^{-1}$ and $2=2^{-1}$.  The next group is $N=5$, here $1=1^{-1}$ and $2\cdot 3=1\cdot 5 + 1$ so
$2=3^{-1}$ and $3=2^{-1}$.  We also have that $4\cdot 4 = 3\cdot 5 + 1$ hence $4=4^{-1}$ in the group when
$N=5$.
